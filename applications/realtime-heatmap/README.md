## Application Description

The Application is a Heatmap computing registered in OpenNESS as a producer application. It uses
a streaming pipeline (either server reading from a stream or user pushing the stream to server) and RTMP server.
It utilizes OpenVINO person-detection and person-reidentification models. The application supports heatmap area
computing (general realtime heatmap) and track-heatmap (personal heatmap track connected to a corresponding person, uses
identity anchors).

## Repository content

The repository contains:

-	Helm package for the installation

## Docker Images

Docker images are located at dockerhub:

- kuberlab/realtimeheatmap:1.0.4
- kuberlab/realtimeheatmap:1.0.4-ffmpeg (this one is compiled with Intel-GPU decoding support for FFMpeg)

Pre Requisites
---
The application has been tested on the following software, which is also required:

* [OpenNESS](https://github.com/open-ness/specs) Network Edge v20.12
* Kubernetes v1.18.4
* Helm v3.1.2

## Installation

### Install the Realtime heatmap

The installation proccess leverage on helm chart. Go to the `helm` folder of the repository, and edit values.yaml:

Notice environment variables:

- STREAM_COUNT=16 (default 16): Specify the needed number of supported streams.
- TRACKHEATMAP=no/yes (default no): Enable the track heatmap only.
- RUNTIME_HEATMAP=yes/no (default yes): Enable the general heatmap only.
- KSERVING=id (default ''): Specify `serving-id` for audience analytics integration

Notice chart variables:

- openness.heatmapId: Specify the producer application id. Needed in case of existing multiple heatmap applications
integrated with audience
- useHDDL=false/true: Load and run model on HDDL device (or not)
- useIntelGPU=false/true: Use Intel GPU for decoding or not
- runOnVCANode=false/true: Runs workload strictly on VCA card (node).

Run the installation:

```bash
helm install realtime-heatmap ./
```

If the installation succeeds, you will see the additional instructions from `helm` output how to test it.

### Consumer Application

The Consumer application here is the Audience analytics application which consumes frames, heatmap labeling and
resulting video chunks generated by heatmap application. Or, alternatively, there is a way to see the output of heatmap
without consumer application, just see mjpg port (see helm outputs above).

### Check application logs to see if it is running

In order to check application logs, you can see directly the pod logs at:

```bash
pod_name=$(kubectl get po -l app=runtime-heatmap --no-headers | awk '{print $1}')
kubectl logs -f $pod_name
```
